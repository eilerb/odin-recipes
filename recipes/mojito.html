    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is an authentic recipe for mojito. 
        I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it 
        accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very refreshing 
        drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. 
        If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing 
        ourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time!
        Tonic water can be substituted instead of the soda water but the 
        taste is different and somewhat bitter.</p>

    <p>Drink responsibly!</p>
